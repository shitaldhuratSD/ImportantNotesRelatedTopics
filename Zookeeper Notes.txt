 Apache ZooKeeper is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source server which enables highly reliable distributed coordination.

 Use Zookeeper as config server when there is a coordination required between different applications. 
 Lets say a large distributed system is running in different cluster and shared/common metadata is required for processing. 
 Metadata information could be store in central Zookeeper server and can be expose via api.
 All application will get meta information from api in real time.

 This Kafka installation comes with an inbuilt zookeeper. Zookeeper is mainly used to track status of nodes present
 in Kafka cluster and also to keep track of Kafka topics, messages, etc.

 Apache Zookeeper is distributed data storage (not designed for large data storage) and mainly used for coordination purposes. 
 Configuration management is one widely used purpose. Distributed systems like Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, Apache Hive, Apache Nifi and 
 many more are using zookeeper.
